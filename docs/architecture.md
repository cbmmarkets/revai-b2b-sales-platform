# RevAI System Architecture

## Overview

RevAI follows a modern microservices architecture designed for scalability, resilience, and maintainability.

## Components

### Frontend

A React-based single-page application (SPA) with:
- Component-based architecture using React and TypeScript
- State management with Redux Toolkit
- Styling with Tailwind CSS
- Data visualization with Recharts

### Backend

A Node.js-based API server with:
- Express.js framework
- MongoDB for primary database
- Redis for caching and session management
- Microservices for specific domains:
  - User Authentication Service
  - Analytics Service
  - Integration Service (CRM connections)
  - AI Prediction Service

### Data Processing Pipeline

- Data ingestion from multiple sources (CRM, email, calendar, etc.)
- ETL processes for data cleaning and transformation
- Machine learning pipelines for model training and prediction

### Infrastructure

- Containerized using Docker
- Orchestrated with Kubernetes
- CI/CD through GitHub Actions
- Cloud-agnostic deployment (AWS primary)

## Data Flow

1. Data is collected from various sources through the Integration Service
2. Raw data is processed and normalized in the ETL pipeline
3. Processed data is stored in MongoDB and used to train ML models
4. AI Prediction Service uses these models to generate insights
5. Frontend retrieves and displays insights through API calls

## Security

- JWT-based authentication
- Role-based access control
- Data encryption in transit and at rest
- Regular security audits and penetration testing

## Monitoring

- Application performance monitoring
- Error tracking and alerting
- User behavior analytics
- System health dashboards
